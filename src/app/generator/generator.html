      <p>I created a <a href="http://yeoman.io/">Yeoman</a> generator for scaffolding an <a href="https://angularjs.org/">Angular</a> application using <a href="http://gulpjs.com/">Gulp</a> as build tool.</p>
      <p>It becomes quite big, I welcomed <a href="https://github.com/zckrs">@zckrs</a> as co-owner and it represent since the major part of my open source contribution.</p>
      <p>The point of the project is having a tool to scaffold a new frontend project with all the state of the art development and optimization process only assuming the us of Angular and Gulp but letting the user choose it's CSS preprocessor (such as Sass or Less), JS preprocessor (such as Coffee or Babel) or it's UI framework (such as Bootstrap or Angular Material) for example.</p>
      <p>This website has bean scaffold with it!</p>
